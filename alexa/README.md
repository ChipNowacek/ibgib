# thingGib: Jib Things Yo
### (Alexa Skill written in TypeScript)

##What is thingGib for Alexa?

Good question! We don't really know...yet.

The thingGib library itself is a nifty idea that you can read about in [its readme](https://github.com/ibgib/thingGib/blob/master/README.md).

So thingGib on Alexa is just as experimental as the thingGib library itself.
Suffice to say, it could be pretty neat, depending on your goals in life
and your vision for the Amazon Echo and voice interaction in general.

##Yo
If you have questions, comments, corrects or all that good stuff, or if you're just
reading this and want to say hello, you can give me (Bill Raiford) a holler at
ibgib@ibgib.com.


##That being said...
Here is a sample dialog, with reprompts/help in parentheses of a possible story.

YOU: Alexa, ask thing jib to create a new thing.

ALEXA: What kind of thing? (You can create any thing based on any other thing as a template. If you don't want to template anything, just say 'root' or 'anything' or 'doesn't matter'. For help, just ask for 'help with creating'. Now, what kind of thing would you like to create?)

YOU: Anything

ALEXA: Ok, we'll create something out of nothing. What would you like to call it?

YOU: Hello World.

ALEXA: Create a new thing called 'Hello World' in your current thing-verse?

YOU: Yes.

ALEXA: Ok. I've created it. Would you like to add things to it now? (Would you like to add things to the new thing we just created?)

YOU: Sure.

ALEXA: Ok. What would you like to add? (You can add a note, property, or other existing or new things, or say 'help with adding').

YOU: Help with adding.

ALEXA: You can add any thing in your thing-verse to any other thing. For example, you can add a new or existing "note" thing. This would create a new thing templated on the existing "note" template and add it to your thing. Or you could add a new or existing custom thing. For example, if you had created something called a "haiku" thing with three notes on it called "Line 1", "Line 2", and "Line 3", you could add this to your thing. Or you could add a new thing based on this "haiku" thing. There is a lot you could do. Check out the help card on the Alexa App for more information. FNow, what would you like to add?

YOU: A note.

ALEXA: Ok. Give the note a name?

YOU: No.

ALEXA: Ok. What would you like the note to say?

YOU: Hello world.

ALEXA: You want the note to say 'Hello world'?

YOU: Yes.

ALEXA: Ok. I've added a that note to your new thing called 'Hello World'. Would you like to add any more things?

YOU: Not right now.

ALEXA: Ok. Would you like me to read out the new thing to you?

YOU: Yes.

ALEXA: Thing named 'Hello World' has one note thing in it. This note says "Hello world". Would you like to do anything else right now?

etc...

I'm not sure if the free text will be entirely possible with Alexa. But it's worth a shot,
and sometime in the future it will be possible.
