## Context (The Big Yellow ibGib)

This ibGib is a big yellow circle because it's the current "Context" ibGib. This is a special ibGib! :smile:

### :baby: :question: :exclamation:

For starters, you can think of it as your current folder. Whenever you fork an ibGib, it will get added to the current context and become one of the larger "Source" ibGibs floating around. If you don't have a Context or if you fork someone else's ibGib, then your new fork _becomes_ the current Context.

Any ibGib that you add _directly_ to the Context will also become one of the free-floating Source ibGib. This includes comments, pics, etc.

### :nerd_face: :grey_question:

* Forking within your own context adds a new Source ibGib.
* The current URL is tied to the Context ibGib.
  * Any added/removed Source ibGib will update your current URL.
* The Source ibGib are any ibGib related to the Context via the \`ib^gib\` rel8n.
* Boring rel8ns (dna, past, ancestor)
