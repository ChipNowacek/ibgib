## This ibGib is a "Source"
### (The Large, Free-Floating Shapes)

"Sources" are the ibGib floating around when you first load an ibGib page. They
are the "source" ibGib within a given Context.

### :baby: :baby_bottle:

For starters, just think of them as the main things that all revolve around the 
big yellow circle.

### :eyeglasses: :point_up:

* Source ibGib are related to the current Context via the Context's \`ib^gib\`
  rel8n.
* When a Source is expanded, its position is pinned.
* You can double-click Sources (and other ibGib) to auto-expand them fully,
  revealing all of their children ibGib (including those from other users).
  * Double-clicking while expanding will halt the expansion.
  * Double-clicking after expanded will collapse the ibGib again.

The Source ibGib are what our hands produce. But these are only meaningful in 
some given Context. If that Context is not given resources, e.g. real estate on
the page, processor time, attention, etc., then the Sources will not get 
resources either. The Root provides the Meta-Context, so all Sources - even 
though we call them "Sources" - derive from the Root.

Just as any ibGib can be a Context to other Sources, any ibGib can be a Source
in other Contexts.
