## This ibGib is the "Root"
### (The Disappearing/Reappearing Green ibGib)

The "Root" ibGib is the green circle that shows up if you click anywhere in the
background. When you're done with it, it fades back into the background.

### :baby_bottle: :baby:

For starters, just remember that the Green Circle is where you can login, create
new circles, and search for circles and squares. 

When you want to search for pics, comments, or other circles, click on the Green
Circle and click on the search button (<span style="background-color: #C7FF4F">:mag:</span>).

In order to upload pics, you'll need to login with at least one email address.
So bring up the Green Circle and click on the login button (<span style="background-color: #FFFFFF; font-family=FontAwesome"><i class="fa fa-sign-in" aria-hidden="true"></i>
</span>).

### :eyeglasses: :grey_question:

* Clicking anywhere on the background will bring up the Root.
* Forking from the Root creates a new "blank" ibGib.
  * If it's in your Context, it will associate the new Fork to the Context.
  * If it's in someone else's Context, or if there is no Context, the new Fork
    will become the current Context.
* All ibGib have the Root as its first Ancestor, Past, DNA, Identity, and Query Result.

"New" is a funny word. In order to describe ibGib, you must use ibGib. When you
question what are the correct concepts and terms to use to define ibGib, you
must inevitably create "new" ibGib to be the things that are doing the 
describing. So, ibGib is unabashedly self-defining, both constructivistically
and prescriptivistically, and the Root is the term
that describes this infinitely large and infinitesimally small recursive
aspect. It's "the" meta ibGib (which is still redundant). 

So, when something - anything - is "magically" declared, like a "new" DNA
ibGib, or Ancestral ibGib, or whatever, it is more accurately described as a
Fork of the Root ibGib in time. This is the "glue" that allows us to unify all
ibGib and come a step closer to capturing the fundamental interconnectedness of
all things.
