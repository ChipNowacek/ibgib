## This ibGib is a "Command"

A Command is how you tell ibGib to do things.

### :baby: :baby_bottle:

For starters, you can just think of commands as buttons. You click a button, and
it does stuff.

### :eyeglasses: :point_up:

* Single-clicking a command executes it.
* Long-clicking a command shows its help (what you're reading right now).

> 'Love the Lord your God  
> &nbsp;&nbsp; with all your heart  
> &nbsp;&nbsp; and with all your soul  
> &nbsp;&nbsp; and with all your mind.'  
> This is the first and greatest commandment.  
> And the second is like it:  
> &nbsp;&nbsp; 'Love your neighbor as yourself.'  
> All the Law and the Prophets  
> &nbsp;&nbsp; hang on these two commandments.  
>
> Matthew 22:37-40

In this passage from Matthew 22, he illuminates the fact that the commandments
are all relevant, but that there is a "greatest" commandment (command pattern
btw). This reveals the underlying mechanism that allows him to build upon the
Law without removing a single period from it (monotonically increasing,
append-only aggregation). Not only do we have binary "do/don't" commands to
follow, but we have the possibility of degrees of "greatness" of each command.
And Jesus is giving us one constraint as to the amount of greatness, that Love
has precedence over all other commands. 

So Fear the Lord your God, yes - but Love the Lord your God is greater.
