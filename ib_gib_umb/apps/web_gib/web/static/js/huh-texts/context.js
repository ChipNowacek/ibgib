## This ibGib is a "Context"
### (The Big Yellow ibGib)

The "Context" ibGib is a big yellow circle like Earth's yellow sun. Most of the
things we do with ibGib will work against the backdrop of our Context.

### :baby: :baby_bottle:

For starters, you can think of it as your current folder. The ibGib you see
on the screen are like the "contents" of your Context folder. Adding ibGib
to your Context, like commenting or adding a pic, is a lot like adding
files and folders to your current folder. So if you make a "Home" ibGib, it's
like creating a "Home" folder where you can store other ibGib. (_But unlike
files and folders, you're not limited to this approach._)

### :eyeglasses: :point_up:

* Any ibGib can be the Context. Just navigate to it via the popup menu and
  choosing the "Goto" command (<span style="background-color: #C7FF4F">:point_up_2:</span>).
* Forking within your own Context adds a new Source ibGib.
* Forking within someone else's Context will create a Fork for you and set it as your current context.
* The current URL is tied to the Context ibGib.
  * Any added/removed Source ibGib will update your current URL.
  * This belies the fact that all ibGib are versioned throughout their evolving
    existence.
* The free-floating Source ibGib are any ibGib related to the current Context
  via its \`ib^gib\` rel8n.

Context provides a point-of-view with respect to relationships among all ibGib.
Since all ibGib have relationships with other ibGib, any ibGib can act as a
Context. This differs from other strictly hierarchical parent/child paradigms
such as that with a file/folder or container/content, where only the
folder/container can have a single relationship (containment) to the
file/content. In the file/folder paradigm, it is odd for a
file to contain a folder, or a folder to be used for its intrinsic content. This
does occur, however, in the form of zip files containing folders, and folders
being used for the metadata those entities contain. But this was an afterthought
that came about for the use-case of portability & compression.

With ibGib, these strictly conceived roles are relaxed a bit to regain the
holistic perspective that each one is indeed the "same thing": ibGib. This
paradigm (re)shift can give us more robust relationships beyond the
hierarchical, even including relationships that are seemingly and paradoxically
self-negating, such as the ever-popular "unrelated" relationship.
