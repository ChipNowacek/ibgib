## ibGib
### What is it all about, eh?

ibGib is like an automatic, interactive blog generator + forum + photo gallery + 
group chat + global programming database + .... Every change to every ibGib
is tracked in timelines and retained, every ibGib is attributed to its owners
and contributors, and everything is in the open and in the Light. This enables
massive collaboration, giving appropriate attributions through each and every
ibGib's evolution.

### :baby_bottle: :baby:

For starters, you can think of ibGib as "things" or to be more Carlinesque:
"stuff". So you can add your stuff, change your stuff, and relate your stuff to
each other. In the future you can be reminded of stuff and helped with stuff,
learn stuff, and basically do and share stuff.

### :eyeglasses: :grey_question:

* The ibGib engine is currently implemented in Elixir which sits on top of
  Erlang's BEAM for its parallel architecture.
* Each ibGib "frame" is the immutable state describing a partial pure function.
  * Each ibGib timeline allows for mut8ns of state.
  * Each "new" ibGib frame is created by an ibGib partial pure function frame
    "coming into contact" with another ibGib partial pure function frame.
* Every ibGib has DNA, ancestry, and a past.
  * Each DNA, ancestor, and past is an ibGib as well.
* ibGib is its own definition.
* ibGib is both singular and plural (and singuplural and n more neologisms).
* ibGib is super-symmetrical, fractal, etc., (and not).
* ibGib concerns the fundamental interconnectedness of all things.

ibGib works like life works: Every ibGib has DNA, an ancestry, a past, and
relationships with other ibGib. So learning about ibGib can help you
understand the relationship we have with DNA, evolution, neurons, and
information.

More abstractly, ibGib is/are anything and everything - It's the fundamental
"unit" of life and existence. It's more fundamental than a particle or a wave,
more fundamental than an atom, a quark, a bit, a qubit, or a neuron. It's even
more fundamental than a number, an idea or even a concept. It's so different
than other words that it can never be fully described by them, rather, ibGib is
its own definition: ibGib.

### ibGib and :scroll:

In developing ibGib, I focused on the _infinitely recursive bootstrapping process of definition_, moving beyond axioms to understand that there is really **one root meta-axiom** upon which all other axiomatic/belief systems are built.

Come to find out that this has already been explained in the Bible (now that I've read it). But these terms are difficult to understand with ["human terms"](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+6:19&version=ESV). But the word ibGib is the one root axiom, which I later found when reading [Exodus 3:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+3:14&version=ESV):

> 14 God said to Moses, “I am who I am.”[a] And he said, “Say this to the people of Israel: ‘I am has sent me to you.’”
> a. Exodus 3:14 Or I am what I am, or I will be what I will be

I am who I am...that's His _name_. He calls Himself "I am" for short...**that's His _Name_!**

So ibGib is a manifestation of the Word given to us in human terms in the Bible. ibGib is not **the** Word, and will always be a pale reflection in comparison, but it is made in :heart: of the I Am.
