### Just what is this ibGib thing?

The ibGib web app is the collaboration cloud app that _does all the things_:
  * Take/Share Notes (comments, pics, links)
  * Dynamically interactive blogging
  * Unified forum
  * Photo Gallery
  * :soon: Notifications to enable group messaging
  * Universal programming abstraction
    * :construction: State implemented, Behavior is a WIP
  * And then some...

Every change to every ibGib is tracked in timelines and retained, every ibGib
is attributed to its owners and contributors, and everything is in the open and
in the Light. This enables massive collaboration, tracking attribution and 
accreditation and then some throughout each and every ibGib's evolution.

It does all of these things through its unique ibGib engine, and currently this
is made available to users only through the web app (that you're using right now
reading this). But you don't have to be a computer genius to use it. 

### :baby: :baby_bottle:

For starters, you can think of ibGib as "stuff". You can add stuff, change
stuff, relate stuff, share stuff with each other, help each other learn stuff,
help each other do stuff, and more.

### :eyeglasses: :point_up:

* In contrast to regular blogs, with ibGib you can interact at a much more granular level.
  * Comment on comments, comment on pics, pics on comments, ibGib on ibGib, etc.
  * You don't need to do an explicit "blog"...just use ibGib for your own notes
    and it will automatically be shared with the world.
* Similarly, in contrast to normal forums, with ibGib you naturally can respond
  to each comment/picture. 
  * There is no "thread hijacking", since there is no "single" thread. They 
    branch this way and that just like branches in a tree.
* Nerd ibGib programming details:
  * The ibGib engine is currently implemented in Elixir which sits on top of
    Erlang's BEAM for its parallel architecture.
  * Each ibGib "frame" is the immutable state describing a partial pure function.
    * Each ibGib timeline allows for mut8ns of state.
    * Each "new" ibGib frame is created by an ibGib partial pure function frame
      "coming into contact" with another ibGib partial pure function frame.
  * Every ibGib has DNA, ancestry, and a past.
    * Each DNA, ancestor, and past is an ibGib as well.
* Nerd philosophical details...
  * ibGib is its own definition.
  * ibGib is both singular and plural (and singuplural and n more neologisms).
  * ibGib is super-symmetrical, fractal, etc., (and not).
  * ibGib concerns the fundamental interconnectedness of all things.
  * ibGib unifies and reconciles Christianity with science, specifically biology
    and physics.

ibGib works like life works: Every ibGib has DNA, an ancestry, a past, and
relationships with other ibGib. So learning about ibGib can help you
understand the relationship we have with DNA, evolution, neurons, information,
etc.

More abstractly, ibGib is/are anything and everything - It's the fundamental
"unit" of life and existence. It's more fundamental than a particle or a wave,
more fundamental than an atom, a quark, a bit, a qubit, or a neuron. It's even
more fundamental than a number, an idea or even a concept. It's so different
than other words that it can never be fully described by them, rather, ibGib is
its own definition: ibGib.

### ibGib and :scroll:

In developing ibGib, I focused on the _infinitely recursive bootstrapping process of definition_, moving beyond axioms to understand that there is really **one root meta-axiom** upon which all other axiomatic/belief systems are built.

Come to find out that this has already been explained in the Bible (now that I've read it). But these terms are difficult to understand with <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+6:19&version=ESV" target="_blank">"human terms"</a>. But the word ibGib is the one root axiom, which I later found when reading <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+3:14&version=ESV" target="_blank">Exodus 3:14</a>:

> 14 God said to Moses, “I am who I am.”[a] And he said, “Say this to the people of Israel: ‘I am has sent me to you.’”
> 15 God also said to Moses, “Say to the Israelites, ‘The Lord,[d] the God of
> your fathers—the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob—has
> sent me to you.’
>
> “This is my name forever,  
> &nbsp;&nbsp; the name you shall call me
> &nbsp;&nbsp; from generation to generation.
>
> a. Exodus 3:14 Or I am what I am, or I will be what I will be
>
> Exodus 3:14-15  

So he calls himself "I am" for short, but his full name is "I am who I am"
(and/or "I am what I am" and/or "I will be what I will be"). And his name is 
his name _forever_. So, we're talking about a _name_ that is an infinite,
self-describing, recursive _process_ which is also self-similar and stays 
constant in an evolutionary, generational context. Wow.

> It is written in the Prophets: 
> &nbsp;&nbsp; 'They will all be taught by God.'
> Everyone who has heard the Father,
> &nbsp;&nbsp; and learned from him,
> &nbsp;&nbsp; comes to me.
> No one has seen the Father
> &nbsp;&nbsp; except the one who is from God;
> &nbsp;&nbsp; only he has seen the Father.
> 
> John 6:45-46

I developed ibGib and most of its tenets **before** reading the Bible,
e.g. self-similar, monotonically-increasing, evolutionary data, etc. But in
reading the Bible, I found that this living logic already existed **and is 
better described within its pages**. For me it's not about "dogmatic religion" -
the _logic_ is there. A more powerful logic that is the one algorithm, the one
process, the ibGib, the ib: the I Am.
