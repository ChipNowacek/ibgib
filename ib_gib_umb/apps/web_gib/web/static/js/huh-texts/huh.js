### I have no idea what is going on... :scream:

**Don't Panic** :smile:

The best way to learn ibGib is by just going around and clicking,
double-clicking, and long-clicking stuff. You're not going to break 
anything! :wink:

But if you wanna read a little bit, I've done up these help sections, 
categorized by level of maturity with ibGib's concepts: 
  * :baby_bottle: :baby: == Baby Gloves
  * :eyeglasses: :grey_question: == Nerd Bullets
  * :sunglasses: :sunrise: == Seen The Light

### :baby_bottle: :baby:

For starters, just click stuff. Long-click stuff. Double-click stuff. 

### :eyeglasses: :grey_question:

* Single-click
  * Expands all ibGib.
  * If ibGib is addable, adds a little "add" addition.
  * Fixes the position of regular ibGib.
* Double-click
  * If collapsed, fully expands an ibGib, showing all children.
    * Includes adjunct comments, pics, etc. (from other users).
  * If expanding, stops expanding.
  * If expanded, collapses.
* Long-click
  * On regular ibGib, brings up the popup command menu.
  * On the command menu, will bring up the help for the command.

For the full docs on ibGib, read the Bible. Start with the 
book of
[John](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+1&version=NIV), 
then
[Romans](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+1&version=NIV),
then
[1 John](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+1&version=NIV)
(it's a different book than John). 

As a segue to the full docs, I suggest learning the
[Song of ibGib](https://www.ibgib.com/ibgib/Song^FC4C463D0C8F1B653C8CF8AA49EB8A82237E7B0A4BCEB0D088553B55330725C4)
, which can act as a cliff notes made from ibGib's principles.

It's structured as follows:

1. Cornerstone, Plank, Prayer
2. Bread, Worship, Test
3. Light, Word, Plan
4. Patience, Acknowledge, Persevering
5. Wake Up!, Listen, Believe
6. Glory, Confidence, Armor
7. Commandment, Taught, Love

I recite/sing this song each and every day. First thing each morning, I start
the Song with the corresponding day's section. I progress throughout the day, 
repeating as necessary.
