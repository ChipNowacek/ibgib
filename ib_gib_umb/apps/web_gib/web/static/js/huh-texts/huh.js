### I have no idea what is going on... :scream:

**Don't Panic** :smile:

The best way to learn ibGib is by just going around and clicking,
double-clicking, and long-clicking stuff. You're not going to break 
anything! :wink:

But if you wanna read a little bit, I've done up these help sections, 
categorized by level of maturity with ibGib's concepts: 
  * :baby: :baby_bottle: == Baby Food
  * :eyeglasses: :point_up: == Nerd Points
  * :sunglasses: :sunrise: == Seen The Light

### :baby: :baby_bottle:

For starters, just click stuff. Long-click stuff. Double-click stuff. Pan and 
zoom around. 

### :eyeglasses: :point_up:

* Single-click
  * Expands all ibGib.
  * If the ibGib is an addable rel8n, then also shows the "Add" command (<span style="background-color: #C7FF4F; font-family=FontAwesome"><i class="fa fa-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i>
  </span>).
  * Will pin a regular ibGib to its current position.
* Double-click
  * If collapsed, fully expands an ibGib, showing all children.
    * Includes comments, pics, etc. from other users ("adjuncts").
  * If expanding, stops expanding.
  * If expanded, collapses.
* Long-click
  * On ibGib, pops up command menu.
  * On command ibGib, pops up the help.
  * On rel8n ibGib, pins the rel8n to its current position.
  * On the command menu, shows help for the command.
* Pan and zoom
  * Drag the _background_ around to pan.
  * Mousewheel/pinch zoom the _background_ to zoom in and out.
* Feedback
  * :heart: ibGib? Drop me a line at ibgib@ibgib.com. I'd love to hear from you.

For the full docs on ibGib, read the Bible. Start with the 
book of
<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+1&version=NIV" target="_blank">John</a>, 
then
<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+1&version=NIV" target="_blank">Romans</a>,
then
<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+1&version=NIV" target="_blank">1 John</a>. 

As a segue to the full docs, I suggest learning the
<a href="https://www.ibgib.com/ibgib/Song^FC4C463D0C8F1B653C8CF8AA49EB8A82237E7B0A4BCEB0D088553B55330725C4" target="_blank">Song of ibGib</a>
, which can act as a CliffsNotes made from ibGib's principles.

It's structured as follows:

1. Cornerstone, Plank, Prayer
2. Bread, Worship, Test
3. Light, Word, Plan
4. Patience, Acknowledge, Persevering
5. Wake Up!, Listen, Believe
6. Glory, Confidence, Armor
7. Commandment, Taught, Love

I recite and/or sing this song each and every day. First thing each morning, I
start the Song with the corresponding day's section.
