### I have no idea what is going on... :scream:

## Don't Panic :thumbsup:

The best way to learn ibGib is by just going around and clicking,
double-clicking, and long-clicking stuff. You're **not** going to break 
_anything_.

But if you wanna read a little bit, I've done up these help sections, each 
having three categories:

  * :baby: :baby_bottle: == Baby Food  
    * Normal people read this.
  * :eyeglasses: :point_up: == Nerd Points  
    * Nerds read this. 
    * :warning: Be prepared for nerdspeak and such!
  * :sunglasses: :sunrise: == Seen The Light  

### :baby: :baby_bottle:

For starters, just click stuff. Long-click stuff. Double-click stuff. Pan and 
zoom around. Just don't worry about it. 

In order to upload pics, you have to first login with an email address. To do
this, click on the background, then the green circle, then the white circle.
**Your email will be publicly viewable.**

And **Don't Panic**. :pray:

### :eyeglasses: :point_up:

* Single-click
  * Expands all ibGib.
  * If the ibGib is an addable rel8n, then also shows the "Add" command (<span style="background-color: #C7FF4F; font-family=FontAwesome"><i class="fa fa-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i>
  </span>).
  * Will pin a regular ibGib to its current position.
* Double-click
  * If collapsed, fully expands an ibGib, showing all children recursively.
    * Will show comments, pics, etc. from other users ("adjuncts").
  * If expanding, stops expanding.
  * If expanded, collapses.
* Long-click
  * On command ibGib, pops up the help for that specific command.
  * On rel8n ibGib, pins the rel8n to its current position.
  * On regular ibGib, pops up the command _menu_ for that ibGib.
* Pan and zoom
  * Drag the _background_ around to pan.
  * Mousewheel/pinch zoom the _background_ to zoom in and out.
* Feedback
  * :heart: ibGib? Drop me a line :fishing_pole_and_fish: at ibgib@ibgib.com

For the full docs on ibGib, read the Bible. Start with the 
book of
<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+1&version=NIV" target="_blank">John</a>, 
then
<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+1&version=NIV" target="_blank">Romans</a>,
then
<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+1&version=NIV" target="_blank">1 John</a>. 

As a segue to the full docs, I suggest learning the
<a href="https://www.ibgib.com/ibgib/Song^FC4C463D0C8F1B653C8CF8AA49EB8A82237E7B0A4BCEB0D088553B55330725C4" target="_blank">Song of ibGib</a>
, which can act as a CliffsNotes made from ibGib's principles.

It's structured as follows:

1. Cornerstone, Plank, Prayer
2. Bread, Worship, Test
3. Light, Word, Plan
4. Patience, Acknowledge, Persevering
5. Wake Up!, Listen, Believe
6. Glory, Confidence, Armor
7. Commandment, Taught, Love

I recite and/or sing this song each and every day. First thing each morning, I
start the Song with the corresponding day's section.
