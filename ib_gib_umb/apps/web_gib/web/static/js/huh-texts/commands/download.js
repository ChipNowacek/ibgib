This command will download the ibGib to your machine/device locally.

Save the pic on your phone so you can see it offline, use it in some other app,
or edit it with your fav editor.

I'm going to do the absolute best job of keeping your files up on the web in
the cloud that I can possibly do. But it's going to take more than just me and
ibGib. It's going to take you downloading your own and others' ibGib. It's 
going to be an interesting game in the future on how to prioritize what we save
and what gets tossed into the fire. With God all things are possible, but let's 
not put him to the test, eh? Download what you feel is important to you. Help 
others by downloading theirs as well. When I get downloading actual ibGib (and
not just the picture files as it is right now), this will be vastly important.
