* If someone else owns the target ibGib, then adding to it will create one
  rel8n going from the "adjunct" to the target.
* If you own the target ibGib, then adding to it will create 2 rel8ns:
  * 1 rel8n from the added "adjunct" ibGib to the target.
  * 1 rel8n going from the target to the adjunct.
* It's called adjunct because...
  * Adjunct captures the essence of what the rel8n is until it is 
    acknowledged and rel8d directly.
  * Plus come on...it's a fun word: adjunct. It's fun just to say it.

In ibGib, when you add a new comment, pic, link, or anything, it will be 
retained by ibGib. 

But when you decide that you want to endeavor in a noble pursuit, such as 
overcoming any urges of the flesh such as overcoming over-eating, smoking,
drinking, etc., then try adding the word to yourself - and retain it. Then by
persevering with the word within you, you _will_ produce a crop.

To retain the word, I built up my 
<a href="https://www.ibgib.com/ibgib/Song^FC4C463D0C8F1B653C8CF8AA49EB8A82237E7B0A4BCEB0D088553B55330725C4" target="_blank">Song of ibGib</a>.
The make this, I would read the Bible. Eventually I decided to try to remember
some of it. So I had a little notebook. I would write down a small passage that
spoke to me, and I would distill that passage's essence down to a single word
title. The first was Glory: 

> To those who,  
> &nbsp;&nbsp; by persistence in doing good,  
> &nbsp;&nbsp; seek glory, honor, and immortality,  
> &nbsp;&nbsp; he will give eternal life.  
>
> Romans 2:7

I wrote it down, very slowly, giving respect to each individual letter as I 
wrote it. If I made a mistake, I tore that page and started fresh. I then
practiced it line by line while I exercised, with a syllable per step. If I 
made a mistake on a line, I would repeat it three times and move on. I would 
then repeat the process until I had that passage down well. This made exercise
go by _extremely_ quickly. 

I did this with multiple other passages, each time giving each passage a 
meaningful, single-word title. I did NOT add another passage if I could not
recite each of the previous passages from memory. Once I realized I had about 
20 or so I collected them into groups that made some sort of sense to me:

1. Cornerstone, Plank, Prayer
2. Bread, Worship, Test
3. Light, Word, Plan
4. Patience, Acknowledge, Persevering
5. Wake Up!, Listen, Believe
6. Glory, Confidence, Armor
7. Commandment, Taught, Love

I then took the groups ordered them by the first title, so I had seven words:

1. Cornerstone
2. Bread
3. Light
4. Patience
5. Wake Up!
6. Glory
7. Commandment

I then made a vivid sequence of pictures in my mind for each word, transforming
from one word to the next. Start with the cornerstone -> morphs into a loaf of
bread -> into a flashlight -> pay shins (with the flashlight) -> alarm clock ->
angels singing -> commanding voice. This kind of thing is a visual mnemonic 
device. Once I had this down a bit, I would recite the passages in that order.
Once I had that down, I "expanded" the individual passages:

1. Cornerstone -> Cornerstone, Plank, Prayer
2. Bread -> Bread, Worship, Test
3. Light -> Light, Word, Plan
4. Patience -> Patience, Acknowledge, Persevering
5. Wake Up! -> Wake Up!, Listen, Believe
6. Glory -> Glory, Confidence, Armor
7. Commandment -> Commandment, Taught, Love

Now I sing the entire song in that order. No other song can compare to the power
of this one. You can try pills, diets, patches, or whatever else - but the true
path to escape the land of Egypt, the land of slavery, is the way and the truth
and the life. When you have ears to listen, you will hear the word and retain
it.
