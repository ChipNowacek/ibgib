* If someone else owns the target ibGib, then adding to it will create one
  rel8n going from the "adjunct" to the target.
* If you own the target ibGib, then adding to it will create two rel8ns:
  1. A rel8n from the added "adjunct" ibGib to the target.
  2. A rel8n going from the target to the adjunct.
* It's called adjunct because...
  * Adjunct captures the essence of what the rel8n is until it is 
    acknowledged and rel8d directly.
  * Plus come on...it's a fun word: adjunct. It's fun just to say it.

In ibGib, when you add a new comment, pic, link, or anything else, it will be 
retained by ibGib. We'll keep it in a computer to the best of our ability, 
maybe even spreading it across multiple servers, nodes, clusters or even 
data-centers to help in case of emergencies and the like. But we don't
guarantee that, since God already has **all** of your data backed up for
_eternity_.

The purpose of ibGib is to grow and develop your relationship with God. The word
itself, ibGib, originally comes from the statement "i believe God is being".
It is to grow belief, belief in god, and that will produce life. Ultimately
this relationship with God comes down to **you** and what **you** retain - not
ibGib. 

I'm going to explain how I have learned to retain the word: By growing and developing my 
<a href="https://www.ibgib.com/ibgib/Song^FC4C463D0C8F1B653C8CF8AA49EB8A82237E7B0A4BCEB0D088553B55330725C4" target="_blank">Song of ibGib</a>.

### Read the Word :coffee: :book:

I started with the book of
<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+1&version=NIV" target="_blank">John</a>, 
then
<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+1&version=NIV" target="_blank">Romans</a>,
then
<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+1&version=NIV" target="_blank">1 John</a>. 

I read the texts in their entirety, slowly and carefully, thinking about them
actively as I read each line. I didn't worry too much when I didn't understand
it all, and I eventually came to realize that this is one of the most beautiful
aspects of the scripture, that it is _re-readable_. 

### Distill the Word :gem:

After reading these and many other books and chapters, eventually I realized
that I wanted to be able to _have_ the word without needing to _read_ the word.
So I had a little notebook that God had given me. I would write down a small
passage that spoke to me, and I would distill that passage's essence down to a
single-word title. For example, my first passage was distilled to the word 
"Glory":

> To those who,  
> &nbsp;&nbsp; by persistence in doing good,  
> &nbsp;&nbsp; seek glory, honor, and immortality,  
> &nbsp;&nbsp; he will give eternal life.  
>
> Romans 2:7


I wrote it down, _very_ slowly, giving respect to each individual letter as I 
wrote it. If I made a mistake, I tore that page and started fresh. I did this 
because I realized I had all the time in _existence_ to get it right. 

### Retain the Word :elephant:

I then practiced the word (in this case, "Glory") line by line while I
exercised, with a syllable per step, much like a musician might practice music
by slowing it down - measure by measure, beat by beat. If I made a mistake on a
line, I would repeat it three times and move on. I would then repeat the
process until I had that passage down well. This made normally monotonous 
exercise go by _extremely_ quickly - better than music, television, or any
other such distractions. 

### Organize the Word :1234: :abcd:

I did this with multiple other passages, each time giving each passage a 
meaningful, single-word title. I did NOT add another passage if I could not
recite each of the previous passages from memory. Once I realized I had about 
20 or so, I realized I had too many to keep track of mentally. So, in order to 
remember them **all**, I collected them into groups that made some sort of
sense to me:

1. Cornerstone, Plank, Prayer
2. Bread, Worship, Test
3. Light, Word, Plan
4. Patience, Acknowledge, Persevering
5. Wake Up!, Listen, Believe
6. Glory, Confidence, Armor
7. Love, Taught, Commandment

I then took the groups ordered them by the first title, so I had seven words:

1. Cornerstone
2. Bread
3. Light
4. Patience
5. Wake Up!
6. Glory
7. Love

### See the Word :eyes:

I then pictured a sequence of vivid (sometimes silly) images in my mind of each
of the words transforming from one word to the next. First a stone
(Cornerstone) that morphed into a loaf of french bread, which then morphed into
a flashlight. This then gets inserted into a big coin slot in someone's shin
(Pay shins, Patience...get it?). This would trigger an alarm clock (Wake up)
which would cue angels singing in the sky (Glory). This in turn changed into
hearts (Love).

1. :anchor: Stone - Cornerstone
2. :bread: French Loaf - Bread
3. :flashlight: Flashlight - Light
4. :moneybag: Pay Shins - Patience
5. :alarm_clock: Alarm Clock - Wake Up!
6. :rainbow: Angels - Glory
7. :two_hearts: Hearts - Love

This may sound ridiculous, but being silly is something that aids in creating 
strong memory traces. Once I had this sequence down, I would recite the
passages in that order. Once I had _that_ down, I "expanded" the individual
passages, tweaking the last one to start with Commandment:

1. Cornerstone -> Cornerstone, Plank, Prayer
2. Bread -> Bread, Worship, Test
3. Light -> Light, Word, Plan
4. Patience -> Patience, Acknowledge, Persevering
5. Wake Up! -> Wake Up!, Listen, Believe
6. Glory -> Glory, Confidence, Armor
7. Commandment -> Commandment, Taught, Love

### Sing the Word :musical_note:

Now I sing the entire song in that order. No other song can compare to the
power of this one. I sing it every day. On Monday, I start and end the day with
Cornerstone. On Tuesday, I do the same with Bread. And so on. This sets up the
Song to be used all day, throughout the day, every day. This is the Word
imprinted on my heart and on my mind.

### Hear the Word :ear:

Now that I have the Song playing in the background of my mind, I can read the
rest of the Bible while having ears to listen. Now I can _hear_ the Word.
