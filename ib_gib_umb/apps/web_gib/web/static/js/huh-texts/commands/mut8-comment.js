* Each mut8n creates a new ibGib frame in the ibGib's timeline.
  * You can see past versions of an ibGib via its "past" rel8n («), but in its
    current incarnation this is a little unwieldy since they are not ordered
    by time.
  * :soon: I'm working on creating an interface that will make it much easier
    to navigate both "past" and "ancestor" rel8ns.

Pretend your playing a game and you have the ability to cheat beyond the 
limits of the game to effect your goals, i.e. you can "cheat to win". Were you 
to do this, what would be the point of the game in the first place? 

If the game is a single game, then yes, if you cheated you could "win" that
single game. And possibly if it were a season, you could cheat and win the
entire season. Maybe you could even get away with it your entire human life. 

But what about your kids? At some point, when things are brought into the light
like we are seeing today with super slow-motion, instant replay, and the like,
others who had "lost" those previous games and their descendants will be better
equipped to win the game. And you and your descendants will be found wanting,
because you were giving yourself noisy feedback in your execution.

Now pretend that your game is the Game of Games - the Meta-Game that encompasses
all games. There is no possibility of cheating, because if you do, then you are
not playing the game. This is because there is no "outside of the game" in which
you can bend the rules. There is only The Game. Jesus was not playing the game
of being Son of Man - of being human. He was playing The Game.

And he won, is winning, and will win again.
