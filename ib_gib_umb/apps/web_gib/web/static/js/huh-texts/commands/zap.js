Even the angels must be reminded in order to walk on the path of truth, the 
truth that gives life:

1. Ephesus: Remember and renew your _love_.
2. Smyrna: Remember the prize that _faith_ will provide.
3. Pergamum & Thyatira: Remember and return to the _fundamentals_ of truth.
4. Sardis: Remember the _feeling_ of truth!
5. Laodicea: Remember the truth that _creates_ wealth.
