## Command: Fork ${getSpan_Fork()}

Forking is fundamental to ibGib: It's how you create "new" ibGib. 

### :baby: :baby_bottle:

For starters, just remember that forking is how you make ibGib babies. Click on
something, fork it, and voilÃ  - you've just made a baby of that ibGib.

### :eyeglasses: :grey_question:

* Forking from the Root is like creating a "brand new" ibGib starting with a "blank" template.
* Forking within your own Context adds a new Source ibGib.
* Forking within someone else's Context will create a Fork for you and set it as your current context.
* Adding a comment actually forks the corresponding parent commentGib and then 
  mut8s the Fork with the comment text.
  * A very similar process happens for pics, links, and others.

'New' is a funny word. In order to describe ibGib, you must use ibGib. When you
question what are the correct concepts and terms to use to define ibGib, you
must inevitably create 'new' ibGib to be the things that are doing the 
describing. So, ibGib is unabashedly self-defining, both constructivistically
and prescriptivistically, and the Root is the term
that describes this infinitely large and infinitesimally small recursive
aspect. It's 'the' meta ibGib (which is still redundant). 

So, when something - anything - is 'magically' declared, like a 'new' DNA
ibGib, or Ancestral ibGib, or whatever, it is more accurately described as a
Fork of the Root ibGib in time. This is the 'glue' that allows us to unify all
ibGib and come a step closer to capturing the fundamental interconnectedness of
all things.
