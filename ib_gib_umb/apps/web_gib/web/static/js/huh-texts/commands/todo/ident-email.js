This command will identify you in ibGib with your email address.

### :baby: :baby_bottle:

For starters, just think of this as the login.

### :eyeglasses: :point_up:

* The security pin is optional.
  * This adds a little bit of security when identifying yourself by 
    your email. 
  * This is not a "password". It's just a one-time pin that you enter before
    we send you the email. Then when you click on the link, you'll enter it
    again. After that, it disappears forever. 
* You can identify yourself with multiple email addresses. 
  * You can do this with as many email addresses as you want, depending on how
    security-conscious you are.
  * If you are signed in with multiple email addresses, any query you run will
    query for any of those identities.
  * Every time you add an email address, you increase the level of required
    identification when mut8ing or rel8ing that ibGib to other ibGib.

Right now, almost all services that you do business with record information on
what you do to improve their services - this makes sense. They want to get 
better, and you want them to get better to provide better products. They work
with diligence to protect your information, but guess what? That's really hard.
And by that, I mean _really_ hard. And it only takes _one_ entity to leak your
information in order to have this break - wow. 

ibGib is taking a different approach to security than other cloud services.
Instead of keeping your info private, the goal is to get as much info into the
Light as possible. 

* Working on something new? 
  * Get it into the Light with your identity so that you get full credit for
    your innovating contribution.
  * Though nowadays with connected technologies, we're much more into the
    problems of "us" and not "mine". The more data you get into the Light, the 
    more accurately your contribution can be measured.
* Afraid of your competition?
  * **That fear of competition is reliant upon full information not being 
    available.** If you are providing a service for customers who will tolerate
    brigandry and banditry, then your customers will force you into the same
    mindset and behaviors. What is the use of gaining the world if you lose your
    soul?
  * We are now at a point in our society where **we need cooperation to address
    the growing complexity of the technologies that we are creating.**
    * This is already manifest in how Open-Source Software works. The next step
      is **Universal, Open Data - not encapsulated & encrypted silos.**
* Afraid of persecution by others abusing this information about you?
  * Get your treatment into the Light. There are countless examples where 
    shedding Light on injustices sparks the fires required for _positive_
    change.
    
I could go on and on here, and maybe elsewhere I shall. But this is a key tenet
of the Bible: bring that which is evil and shameful into the Light so that it 
may turn into good. Don't be afraid, and have confidence that the Lord is your 
helper. In the future, all will be brought into the Light.
