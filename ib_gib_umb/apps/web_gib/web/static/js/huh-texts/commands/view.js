This looks at stuff. Look at a pic fullscreen. Look at a comment in a big 
window. Look at stuff.

### :eyeglasses: :point_up:

* In general, if we have an ibGib then we can have a rendering strategy.
  * Right now, this strategy is hard-coded for pics and comments.
  * :soon: In the future, this will enable more dynamic viewing of ibGib.

it is in your own eye?
