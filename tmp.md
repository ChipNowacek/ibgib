# Evolution, Christ and ibGib

### Loaded Questions

When developing ibGib, I continually would revisit a very interesting concept which was first introduced to me in elementary school. Kids would ask, "Do your parents know that you're gay?" This kind of thing comes in multiple flavors, and maybe today's version would be LGBT or something similar. Eventually, it became common knowledge to a younger me that this type of thing is called a 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loaded_question" target="_blank">loaded question</a>.

### Logical Fallacies

Following the Wikipedia path for this could then lead you to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy_of_many_questions" target="_blank">fallacy of many questions</a> and many other conventionally known logical constructs. Conventional logics, including many of the defeasible and non-monotonic logics that I've studied, as well as every axiomatic Mathematical system, use this kind of language and approach to these types of patterns. 

There is one common thread among these, and ironically, they all are related to the Loaded Question/Fallacy of Many Questions in a meta-sense.

This is the language of the normal super-(duper-)smart math and logic nerds. It creates a very useful logical language math-type people understand intuitively. This, after all, is how mathematics is built. People think in terms of "truths" and "falses", 0s and 1s, bits of information. In my eyes, most, if not all, have fallen prey to thinking that rigorous proofs are equivalent to truth.

And if you're wondering if I remotely relate to this universe, consider that I got an 800 Math SAT, 36 Math ACT, was my high school's Math Club president, got 5th place in individual state math tournament, with 1st place team placement...all when doing literally less than a day of math homework in my entire youngster schooling. (I did next-to-no homework in general, and certainly not in math where I understood it better than the teacher before he/she finished the sentence.)

### Schroedinger's Advocate

Instead of looking at statements, and information in general, in a binary sense with some sort of absolute, ontological value, ibGib instead defers any and all judgments and evaluations indefinitely. The "wave function" **never collapses**, so to speak. Instead, both the statement and the interpretation of the statement are composed of "the same stuff": ibGib. What you're actually doing when even thinking about this sort of thing is deciding where you want to point your attention gun, which is constantly "creating more" of these ibGib.

It may be easier to think of this with Schroedinger's famous cat thought experiment. If you aren't familiar with this, then you can check it out on the all knowing Wikipedia. The point is that the "observation" that "collapses" the wave function of the state of the cat can itself be considered to be inside a new box. This is apparent when you consider _what actually happens_ when this sort of thing is done: people argue about the interpretation of the results. There is no single magical "yes/no/alive/dead/etc." result for several reasons, but here are the two that I like: 

1. If any of the observers has ever made a mistake, then there is a non-zero probability that they have made a mistake with their observation.
2. Assumptions of the nature of existence, and specifically with regards to time travel, cast non-zero doubt on the possibility of a concrete interpretation.

These two aspects are where current logical & mathematical approaches fall severely short in terms of robustness. Smart people, who so often are _dogged_ in their quest for understanding suddenly start using terms like "negligible" and "approximation". This is where ibGib comes in.

### ibGib as Populations

ibGib is the "single fundamental unit of existence". It's the "stuff" that makes up "stuff". It's the "stuff" that makes up "interpretations of stuff". It the thing that includes the experiment, the experimenters, the interpretations of the experimenters, the interactions of the experimenters with each other and their experiments. It allows for infinite recursion, as well as finite blinders. It is the essence behind how a neural network operates, and how aggregating neural networks are related to evolution.
